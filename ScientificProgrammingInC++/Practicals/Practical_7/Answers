Practical 7 Solutions/Comments

1) The year should be an int. The day and month should be unsigned ints
   The daysInMonth could be put into the Date class as a static member or just
   left as a global variable.

2) For leap-years, implement daysInMonth as a private function that just uses an
   array as before for all months except February.
   Recall that 1900 was not a leap-year, but 2000 was.
